# CosmWasmSigningClient

## About

The class `CosmWasmSigningClient` is exported from the CosmJS package
`@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate` (ðŸ”—
[Link](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/tree/main/packages/cosmwasm-stargate)).

`CosmWasmSigningClient` extends `CosmWasmClient`, so all methods described in
the ðŸ”— [CosmWasmClient documentation ](../../reading/CosmWasmClient.md) work here
too.

This client is used to work with signed transactions. To instantiate it, a
wallet must be connected. For this, please refer to the setup documentation.
