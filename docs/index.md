# Introduction

## What is CosmJS?
CosmJS is the Swiss Army knife to power JavaScript based client solutions ranging from Web apps/explorers over browser extensions to server-side clients like faucets/scrapers in the Cosmos ecosystem.

"Cosm" is short for Cosmos and "JS" is short for runs everywhere â€“ we actually develop in TypeScript.

## Why CosmWasmJS?
Because CosmJS tries to cover all client solutions for the Cosmos ecosystem, it can quickly become difficult for new developers to understand how to get started.

CosmWasmJS was created exclusively for dApp developers and combines the necessary features from CosmJS with powerful helper functions to support especially new devs.
