# Command Line Interface (CLI)

## About

With CosmWasmJS also comes a command line client, which (because of NPX) does
not necessarily have to be installed in the project, but can also be installed
globally.

It is completely based on
[@cosmjs/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/cli).

## Usage

```sh
npx cosmwasm
```
